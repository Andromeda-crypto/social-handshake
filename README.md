# ü§ù Social Handshake

## üí≠ The Origin Story

This project was born from a casual conversation with a friend who mentioned how tedious it was that he couldn't send LinkedIn connection requests to all the people he follows on Instagram at once. That simple frustration sparked an idea: what if there was a tool that could bridge these two networks while staying within platform regulations and respecting user privacy?

Social Handshake is the result of that idea - a practical solution that helps you efficiently connect with your Instagram following on LinkedIn, without violating any terms of service or automating actions that platforms prohibit.

## üéØ What It Does

Social Handshake is a web application that helps you efficiently connect with people you follow on Instagram by finding them on LinkedIn. Instead of manually searching for hundreds of usernames one by one, this tool lets you upload your Instagram following data and provides a streamlined interface to search for them on LinkedIn in bulk.

## üí° The Problem It Solves

Many professionals follow interesting people on Instagram but struggle to connect with them on LinkedIn for networking purposes. Manually searching for each person is tedious and time-consuming. Social Handshake automates the tedious parts while keeping you in control of the connection process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Stays Compliant

Unlike tools that automatically send connection requests (which violates LinkedIn's terms of service), Social Handshake:
- **Only opens LinkedIn search pages** - you manually decide whether to connect
- **Doesn't automate any LinkedIn actions** - all connections are done by you
- **Respects rate limits** - staggers search tab opening to be browser-friendly
- **No API abuse** - uses publicly available search URLs, no scraping or unauthorized access
- **Keeps you in control** - every connection request is your decision

This approach ensures you stay within platform guidelines while still saving hours of manual work.
